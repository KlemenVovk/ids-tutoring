# IDS tutoring hours


Welcome to the resources for tutoring sessions for the Introduction to Data Science course (2023/24) @ UL FRI.

## Intro

This course can be overwhelming to people without computer science backgrounds due to the sheer breadth of topics covered. At tutoring hours I will try my best to reintroduce some concepts that you've already heard about at lectures and labs, and give more intuition and examples at a slower pace than the labs. The main goal for these hours is that they save you more time than they eat up.

## The proposed structure
This is my first time doing this formally. I'm very open to feedback and we can adjust anything ad-hoc. It's a bit hard to judge the correct pace and topics to delve into since they are so different, but the current plan is as follows:

The tutoring hours will be structured into 2 parts:
- demonstrations: 3(+-1)h sessions where I explain a particular topic and solve an exercise with you on the projector, then you are given an exercise to solve on your own laptops while I am in the classroom to provide assistance.
- individual work: I will be available in a classroom (TBD) for 2 hours per week, and you can come with a particular problem (or for another explanation) individually. Also, you can always reach me on Discord (Klemen V.) and we can try to solve your issue online or set up to meet in person.

Currently there are 4 demonstrations planned:
1. Python and the data science ecosystem of libraries for Python (pandas, etc.)
2. Web scraping
3. Docker
4. SQL

The time and place will be voted for and published on Discord, as well as here, once both are known.

**Again, don't hesitate to contact me for any explanations, questions or issues you are having and I will try my best to help you. Also ping me with any feedback you have.**
