# Web scraping

## The why, when and how
**Why:** sometimes the dataset you want just isn't available (you've searched on [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) ...), or you're working with data with a time dimension and want the newest data (e.g. news, stock prices, etc.).

**When:** whenever you can't find a csv/json/other data file, but know where the data is online.

**How:** I will propose a division of web scraping into 2 types:
1. Web scraping using APIs
2. Web scraping with browser automation

If you have to do scraping, always prefer 1. over 2. (the purpose of an API is to expose data - this is exactly what you want) However, it may not always be possible (the API might not be publicly available, it might be paid, it might not expose all the data you want, etc.). The second option is way more flexible and can work on any site you can view, however it is also way more error prone and can be clunky to execute.

## But, how does the web work?

Let's start by giving a brief introduction on how the web works. There's a lot more to it, I will only mention the parts you need to know for web scraping.
